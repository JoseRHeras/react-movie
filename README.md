#Project origin
The following app was created following a react tutoria on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bxWgYfN4CQ&ab_channel=Weibenfalk
Its main objective is to serve as foundation on the learning procedure of creating react apps. 

#Future goals
As of now there are no further plans of improvement. If you would like to use it please feel free to do so. Even better I recomend
to use the learning source, since it goes into much detail about the features included in the app.
