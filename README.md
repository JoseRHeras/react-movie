#Project origin
The following app was created following a educational tutorial on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bxWgYfN4CQ&ab_channel=Weibenfalk
Its main objective is to serve as a guide on the learning path on the procedure used on the creation of web apps using React JS.
Therefore, it is possible that many of its content could be found in other peoples work. I, by no means own any of the content in the 
app. 

#Future goals
As of now there are no further plans of improvement to be made. If you would like to use it for your own please feel free to do so. Even better, I recomend
to use the learning source, since it goes into much detail about the features included in the app.
